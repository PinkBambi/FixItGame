### FixItGame ###
This is meant to be a game that makes the participants take turns to edit a code. The first person comes up with a problem or quest and the next one has to solve it. Then the second person needs to write his/her own problem/quest. 

It's important to think in simple paths. The participants are not meant to solve this fast. Make it so simple so that that there are no simple solutions left and the next person in line needs to step up "their game". This is a exercise to come up with the easiest solutions to coding tasks.

I will make a platform to place this in and write notes so that it's easier to find where and why.
