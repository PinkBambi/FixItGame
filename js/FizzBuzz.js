/**
 * Game: FIZZ BUZZ
 * This is the actual playground. This is where we are going to write our code to make this game work.
 * This page is one game. We will write every game in a new file.
 *
 * Our first game is going to be Fizz Buzz.
 *
 * RULES (Wikipedia):
 * Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
 * Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz",
 * and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".
 *
 * The game is to be written in Javascript as the file suggests, jQuery and Angular are also allowed. Do not forget to make it simple.
 *
 * I'll start ^ ^ /PinkBambi
